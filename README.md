React Native builder (android) based on Arch Linux. Android platforms and sdk build tools for most popular react-native modules included.

There are two versions of builder: `-min` and full which contains more android platforms and sdk build tools.  


## Building

If you are using minimal image check 'Android support library' section first.

```bash
git clone https://.../myproject.git
cd myproject
yarn
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
 

## Both images

### Android SDK

- **latest**

### Android platform tools

- **latest**

## Minimal image (-min)

Contains only required packages for building basic projects with no third-party modules. In most cases you will need to install extra `platforms` and `sdk build-tools` with pacman or use this image as basic for your own image. 

### Packages

All package versions are recent for building date.

- **nodejs**
- **yarn**
- **npm**
- **watchman**
- **openjdk8**
- **git**

### Platforms

- **26**

### SDK build tools

- **26.0.3**

You can install extra sdk build tools with pacman:
```bash
pacman --noconfirm -Sy android-sdk-build-tools-25.0.1
```
(x.0.0 is named `android-sdk-build-tools-x`)

### Android support library

Support library is available in Google maven repository now. Simply add this repository to `android/build.gradle`:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://maven.google.com' }
        ...
    }
}
```  

...or install with pacman:
```bash
pacman --noconfirm -Sy android-support-repository
```

### Google repository

```bash
pacman --noconfirm -Sy android-google-repository
